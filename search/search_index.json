Each component belongs to a specific category, such as \"Params\" for primitive data types or \"Curves\" for curve-related tools.</p> <p></p> <p>Each category of components is given its own panel. To switch between categories, you click the tabs on the top of the panel. For example, clicking the \u2018vector\u2019 tab will display all vector components and clicking the \u2018curve\u2019 tab will display all curve related components. Within each of these categories you will see that the components are grouped into sub-categories that further organize components.</p> <p>Since there can be a large number of components per sub-category, we only display the most commonly used ones in the main panel. If you want to see the entire collection, simply click on the dark grey bar with the little arrow at the bottom of the panel. When you click on the bar, a category panel will pop up, giving you access to all the objects. In this panel, you have two options: you can either click on the objects in the popup list, or you can directly drag them from the list onto the canvas. Personally, I prefer the click method as the drag method sometime creates two of the same components!</p> <p>Clicking on buttons will not automatically add them to the canvas. To add a component to your canvas, you must click once on the component icon, and then once again on the canvas itself.</p> <p>You can find where a component lives in the panel by holding Ctrl+Alt on your keyboard and hold clicking on a canvas component. This command will circle and arrow the exact location of the component!</p> <p>You can also double click an empty portion of the canvas to search for a component by name.</p> <p>Hover over everything!</p> <p>You can hover over components in the panel, the search bar, and on the canvas to display a text description of what said component does. Do this often, especially while you are learning!</p> <p></p> <p>This panel houses all the primitive data types, such as numbers, texts, and boolean values. You can use these components to input or generate data for your designs.</p> <p></p> <p>If you need to perform mathematical operations within Grasshopper, the Math panel is where you'll find the relevant components. It includes components for basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, and more.</p> <p></p> <p>In the Sets panel, you'll find components for working with sets and lists of data. You will primarily use the list sub-category to organize your Grasshopper data. More advanced components allow you to perform set operations on the data itself, such as union, intersection, difference, and more.</p> <p></p> <p>The Vector panel is where you'll find components related to vector operations. Vectors represent direction and magnitude, and they are fundamental in many design and computational geometry tasks. This panel provides components for creating, manipulating, and analyzing vectors within Grasshopper.</p> <p>In addition to vectors, you will also find commands related to planes and points. Planes will allow you to orient geometry while points will allow you to define specific locations in space.</p> <p>The Vector panel is particularly useful when working with geometric transformations, such as translating or orienting objects in space. You can use the components in this panel to define and manipulate vectors, planes, and points that control the direction and magnitude of these transformations.</p> <p></p> <p>In the Curves panel, you'll find a variety of tools and components related to curves. This includes components for creating, manipulating, and analyzing curves in your Grasshopper projects.</p> <p></p> <p>The Surfaces panel provides components for working with surfaces. You can create, modify, and analyze surfaces using the tools available in this panel.</p> <p></p> <p>If you're working with 3D meshes, the Mesh panel is where you'll find the necessary components. It offers tools for creating, editing, and analyzing meshes in Grasshopper</p> <p></p> <p>The Intersect panel in Grasshopper houses components for finding intersections between geometric entities. It includes tools to identify points, curves, surfaces, and other objects where they intersect or overlap. These components are vital for geometry analysis, spatial relationships, and generating complex shapes.</p> <p></p> <p>The Transform panel contains components for transforming geometry in various ways. This includes translation, rotation, scaling, and other transformations that allow you to manipulate objects in your Grasshopper projects.</p> <p></p> <p>The Display panel offers components for visualizing your data and designs. It includes components for creating 2D and 3D graphics, controlling colors, and setting up visualization parameters.</p> <p></p> <p>The Kangaroo panel in Grasshopper is dedicated to the Kangaroo physics engine, a powerful tool for simulating and modeling physical behavior within your designs. This panel contains components that enable you to apply constraints and forces to your geometry, allowing you to simulate structural, mechanical, and natural systems.</p> <p>By utilizing the Kangaroo panel's components, you can add realistic physics-based behavior to your designs, enabling you to explore and analyze how objects interact, deform, and respond to external forces. The Kangaroo panel opens up a world of possibilities for creating interactive and dynamic designs in Grasshopper.</p>"},{"location":"gh/interface/#the-canvas","title":"The Canvas","text":"IntroWorking in the canvasCanvas Widgets <p>Welcome to the Grasshopper canvas!
