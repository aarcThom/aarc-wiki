# Temp Notes

I want to start sort of like TP. Introduce expressions, operators, and basic arithmetics.

Unlike, TP and PCC, introduce concept of *object* early. Relate this to type. Go into built-in functions, and then object methods.

Variables - still in numbers.

And then strings.

## Expressions, Statements, Operators

TP - Arithmetic Expressions - this more or less will cover numbers too
(TP Arithmetic Operators)[https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/think-python/9781098155421/ch01.html#arithmetic-operators]

Ref PCC as added reading but not essential. Explain difference between floats and numbers.


## Functions, Objects, Methods, Types
[TP types](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/think-python/9781098155421/ch01.html#values-and-types)

## Strings
